# calculator_with_history
This is a simple command-line calculator built using Python that supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A unique feature of this calculator is that it maintains a history log of all the calculations performed during the session.  
This is my first basic and simple project on python 
Looking forward to make more advanced projects using python
